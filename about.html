<h4>University</h4>
<p>After university like a lot of 20 somethings I graduated (with distinction I might add) with an MSc in International Business Management but no idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I didn't feel old or mature enough to get a 'serious' job in the city so I decided to apply for jobs abroad. These ranged from jobs teaching English in SE Asia and China to marketing jobs in the Caribbean (why not!) and various cities in Europe. I was lucky enough to get a job offer from BIME Analytics a fledgling cloud business intelligence company based in Montpellier in the south of France. I arrived in France, barely knowing the language (I'd done French for 2 years at school), not knowing anyone in the city and just about to start my first full time job. To say I was nervous is a large understatement but accepting this job and taking a bit of a risk by moving to Montpellier was the best decision I've made in my short career.</p>

<h4>France</h4>
<p>What I found in Montpellier was a super enthusiastic, young, ambitious and most of all extremely friendly team. The tech industry really suited me and being a SaaS solution, nearly all my work was online. Part of my role there was to update the website and this was my first introduction to code, teaching myself basic HTML and CSS so I could update and optimize traffic through the website. I think it was here I caught the coding bug. In short I spent two years working there and really loved it and the only reason I moved back was to be closer to family and friends back in the UK.</p>

<h4>London</h4>
<p>I have had two more jobs back in the UK, I was Marketing Manager for an Ad-Tech Startup, Brainient and marketing executive for an IT Consultancy, Company 85. Although I enjoyed parts of both of these jobs it became apparent that it wasn't so much the marketing which I was enjoying, it was more the online side of it all. Since France I'd been doing online courses, CodeAcademy, free video tutorials but could only get so far. As my indifference to marketing got stronger and the coding bug grew I started to look for routes into coding as a career rather than just a side pursuit. I researched doing another Masters but I'd seen some worrying statistics about getting a job after such degrees. I decided to do Makers Academy, a 12 week coding bootcamp.</p>

<h4>Code</h4>
<p>Makers Academy has been one of the most intense 12 weeks of my life. I've had a taste of Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Angular JS to name but a few languages and learnt a huge amount. 12 weeks is only enough time to scratch the surface of these languages but Makers teaches best practice and gives the basis to be successful in a junior developer role. If I can progress this much in the 12 weeks at Makers (take a look at my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/jelgar1/" target="_blank">github</a> and <a href="/projects" class="link" target="_blank">projects</a>) then I'm excited about how far I can go after more months, years, jobs, experiences in tech. So that's what I'm looking for now, a job where I can continue to learn and surround myself with code and people enthusiastic about code! I'm currently based in London but my previous experiences tell me it's sometimes good to do something a bit different, so I'd love to hear from anyone with a good code story to tell!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
